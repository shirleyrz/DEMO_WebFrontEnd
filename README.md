Data Visualization Web API Demo

================


This repository contains 3 screens I am building. 
[basic function]
1-3: create a new chart by clicking the green-plus pane
4-6: filter chart based on the right navigation bar; click the [change chart] button to switch to histogram or line chart
7-8: try the scroll pane

P.S. Please run the server before demo. All data behind the charts is randomly generated/hardcoded for now, it's not connecting to the back-end server yet.
[Languages: JavaScript, jQuery, jQuery UI, Bootstrap, chart.js etc. ]
